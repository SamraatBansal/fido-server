## Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
1. **Security First**: All implementations must prioritize security
2. **FIDO2 Compliance**: Strict adherence to FIDO2 specifications
3. **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for WebAuthn operations
4. **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users
5. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling

### Security Requirements
1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Assume all inputs are malicious
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access permissions
4. **Secure by Default**: Secure configurations out of the box
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring

### Compliance Requirements
1. **FIDO2 Alliance**: Full compliance with FIDO2 specifications
2. **WebAuthn Level 2**: Support for all Level 2 features
3. **Privacy Regulations**: GDPR and CCPA compliance
4. **Security Standards**: OWASP and NIST compliance
5. **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive audit trails

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity**: Break down into manageable phases
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies minimal and updated
- **Performance**: Regular performance testing and optimization
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### Security Risks
- **Vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Data Breaches**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance**: Regular compliance assessments
- **Incidents**: Incident response procedures and testing

### Project Risks
- **Timeline**: Regular milestone reviews and adjustments
- **Resources**: Cross-training and knowledge sharing
- **Quality**: Comprehensive testing and code reviews
- **Documentation**: Living documentation with regular updates

## Success Metrics
